[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

## Debugging Examples
1) Example 1:
    - ratings      = [1, 0, 2]
    - distribution = [2, 1, 2]

2) Example 2:
    - ratings      = [1, 2, 2]
    - distribution = [1, 2, 1]
      - Note:
         * The third child's rating is equal to second one, thus, her/his candy \
         does not have to get greater number of candy. One candy is enough

3) Example 3 (*):
    - ratings      = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    - distribution = [1, 2, 3, 4]

4) Example 4 (*):
    - ratings      = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    - distribution = [4, 3, 2, 1]

5) Example 5 (*):
    - ratings:     = [2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]
    - distribution = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1]

6) Example 6 (*):
    - ratings:     = [1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 1]
    - distribution = [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1]

## Problem Clarification
- Key points:
    - Each children must have at least one candy.
        - Initialize an array which is called **candies** represents the number of candies.
            - The intialized values of each element is 1.
    - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
        - Compare conditions:

            1) 
                ```
                    ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1] && candies[i] >= candies[i - 1]
                ```
            2)
                ```
                    ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1] && candies[i] <= candies[i - 1]
                ```
            3)
                ```
                    ratings[i] < ratings[i + 1] && candies[i] >= candies[i + 1]
                ```
            4)
                ```
                    ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] && candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]
                ```

## The Optimal Idea
- Intialized the array **left** and **right** which have the same length as **ratings**.

- Each element of the **left** and **right** arraies is 1, because each children has at least one candy.

- The **left** array represents the condition that if the **ratings[i]** is greater than the **ratings[i - 1]**. Therefore, the **left[i]** = **left[i-1]** + 1.

- The **right** array represents the condition that if the **ratings[i]** is greater than the ratings **[i + 1]**. Therefore, the **right[i]** = **right[i+1]** +1.

- The values of the **left** and **right** are 
updated separated in the separate loops.

- Need to meet the condition that the **candies[i]** is greater than the **candies[i-1]** and the **candies[i+1]**, thus the finall **candies[i]** is the maximum of the **left[i]** and **right[i]**.
  
- Finally, the **total** variable which contains the minimum number of candies is calculated based on the formula **total += max(left[i], right[i])**.
